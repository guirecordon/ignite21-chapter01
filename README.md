# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is simply a lesson review of chapter I of Ignite (track 21)--which is an advanced Javascript course provided by a coding school named Rocketseat.

For those who don't know or do not speak Portuguese, [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) is perhaps the biggest JavaScript community in Brazil.

This lesson review will cover the following topics:

## Sass

## State Management

## HTTP requests

## TypeScript

### My name is Gui Recordon and I'm just a fun loving Javascript developer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
